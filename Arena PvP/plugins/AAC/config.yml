#### AAC Config (Generated by AAC 3.3.9)
#
# Hey there,
#   Welcome to AAC's configuration file.
#   I've commented the entire thing heavily so every option is easy to understand.
#   If you want a simple place to start, feel free to check out the "Common changes" section below.
#   Feel free to read through the descriptions of checks and options and change them to suit your server.
#   I hope that AAC will perform well and live up to your expectations.

#
# How violations work:
#  - When a player trips a check in AAC, it generates a "violation" which describes what went wrong, and what was
#    expected.
#  - Details about this violation, along with player data, server tps, etc. are saved to a log file in plugins/AAC/logs,
#    with a millisecond-precision timestamp.
#  - The check then generates a number based on options in this config and the details of what happened. If the
#    violation was more severe, the check will generate a bigger number.
#  - This number is added onto a player's "violation level", or "VL". A player's VL also decays over time when they
#    play without tripping checks in AAC. A player has a seperate VL for each check.
#
# How commands work:
#  - Each check has a section labelled "thresholds". This consists of a list of "threshold actions", each of which is a
#    number paired with a command or list of commands.
#  - When a player's VL (see above) for a check goes above the number, or "threshold" for a threshold action, the
#    threshold action is triggered and the command is executed.
#  - The command won't be executed again until the player's VL decays below that number, and then rises above it again.
#  - If there are multiple commands in the same threshold action, they are all executed in the order they appear.
#
# Common changes:
#  - Reducing teleports or setbacks:
#     -> Fly and Speed are the main checks which set back for movement.
#        -> Change fly.min_vl to a high value so players need to have a higher VL (see above) before being teleported.
#        -> Do the same for speed.min_vl.
#  - Improving hit detection:
#     -> Hitbox sometimes cancels hits if a player is laggy.
#        -> You can increase hitbox.move_compensation and/or max_reach to reduce reach violations for laggy players.
#        -> You can increase hitbox.lenience to relax how directly the attacker needs to look at their target.
#        -> You can increase hitbox.min_vl so players need to have a higher VL (see above) before having hits cancelled.
#     -> For hardcore PVP servers, the killaura check could affect PVP because it very slightly changes entity hitboxes.
#        -> You may need to set killaura.enabled -> false if this is a problem for your players.
#  - Changing kicks:
#     -> Kicks are caused by a threshold action tied to an /aackick command.
#        -> You can remove the threshold action with an /aackick command for a check to disable kicking.
#        -> You can increase the threshold for the threshold action to make kicking more lenient.
#        -> You can reduce the threshold for the threshold action to make kicking more strict.
#  - Other:
#     -> Look in the logs for a timestamp that matches a problem that you've experienced.
#     -> Find out which check was tripped.
#     -> Locate that check in this config file.
#     -> Look for a relevant option, and change it as described by the comment.
#     -> If you can't solve the issue, please check out the issue tracker or discord server for support.
