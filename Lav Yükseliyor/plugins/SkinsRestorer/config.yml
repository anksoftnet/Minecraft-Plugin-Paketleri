# If we break things, you can disable it here.

# Disabling this will stop SkinsRestorer from changing skins when a player loads a server resource pack.
# When a player loads a server resource pack, their skin is reset. By default, SkinsRestorer reapplies the skin when the player reports that the resource pack has been loaded or an error has occurred.

# <!! Warning !!>
# Enable this will require players to run "/skin update" to update their skin.

# <!! Warning Experimental !!>
# This enables the experimental ProtocolLib integration that allows instant skins on join.
# Use with caution! This may decrease your TPS.
EnableProtocolListener: false

# <!! Warning !!>
# When enabled if a skin gets applied on the proxy, the new texture will be forwarded to the backend as well.
# This is optional sometimes as the backend may pick up the new one of the proxy.
# It is recommended though to **KEEP THIS ON** because it keeps the backend data in sync.
# This feature is required for solutions like RedisBungee and also fixes bugs in some cases.

# Useful tools:
# Vectier Thailand has made some super cool "Custom Skin" tools that you can use!
#

# With SkinFile Generator, you can upload your own custom skin to get a unique .skin file that you can put in your skins folder, to use with SkinsRestorer.
# Check it out here: https://skinsrestorer.github.io/SkinFile-Generator/
#
# SkinSystem :
# With SkinSystem, you, as a server owner, can connect AuthMe (and forum) with the SkinSystem website that you can host, to give your players the ability to upload custom skins.
