# the messages in this section can be customised for each rankup in rankups.yml.
rankup:
  requirements-not-met: "&c 你还需要 {MONEY} 才能够升级。"
  no-rankup: "&e你已经处在最高的等级了。"
  # set to an empty string, ie: success-public: ""
  # to hide that message.
  success-public: "&a玩家 {PLAYER} &e升级到: &d{RANK}"
  success-private: "&a你已经升级到: &d{RANK}"

  must-prestige: "&cYou must prestige to /rankup further!"

  # you can (and probably should) you override these in rankups.yml
  # to show the specific requirements for each rank.
  # however if you are just using money or don't need to change the message per rank, you can use any combination of:
  # {MONEY} {MONEY_NEEDED} {PERCENT_DONE <requirement>} {PERCENT_LEFT <requirement>} {AMOUNT <requirement>} {AMOUNT_NEEDED <requirement>}
  # {MONEY} and {MONEY_NEEDED} are different from {AMOUNT money} and {AMOUNT_NEEDED money} in that they use a different format.
  # here is an example of showing the requirements for just money:
  #list:
  #  complete: "&7{OLD_RANK} &8\xbb &7{RANK} &efor &7${MONEY}"
  #  current: "&c{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &c{RANK} &efor &a${MONEY} &e{PERCENT_DONE money}%"
  #  incomplete: "&r{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &r{RANK} &efor &a${MONEY}"
  list:
    complete: "&7{OLD_RANK} &8\xbb &7{RANK}"
    current: "&c{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &c{RANK}"
    incomplete: "&r{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &r{RANK}"
    # an empty string disables the header/footer
    header: ""
    footer: ""
  # sent when a player tries to rankup when they are on cooldown
  cooldown:
    singular: "&c你必须等候 {SECONDS_LEFT} 才能够再次升级！"
    plural: "&c你必须等候 {SECONDS_LEFT} 才能够再次升级！"
# prestige messages can also be customised
prestige:
  requirements-not-met: "&cYou need {MONEY} money to prestige."
  no-prestige: "&eYou are at the highest prestige."

  success-public: "&a{PLAYER} &ehas prestiged to: &d{RANK}"
  success-private: "&aYou have prestiged to: &d{RANK}"

  confirmation: |-
    &eAre you sure you want to prestige to &a{RANK}&e?
    &eType &c/prestige &eagain to confirm.
